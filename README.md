Lemonade App with JetPack Compose
===================================

The Lemonade app is a simple app that allows the user to make digital lemonade by tapping through
a series of steps: select a lemon from the tree, squeeze the lemon, drink the glass of lemonade,
and start again.

Concepts Covered:
- Simple UI Layout in Compose
- Add Clickable behaviour in Compose
- Use remember and mutableIntStateOf to keep track of relevant state in the app
- Use of Scaffold, topBar, Surface
- Reuse a Composable in different when() conditional statement.
